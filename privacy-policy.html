            <span class="content-updated">Last updated January 01, 2020</span>
            
            <p>Thank you for visiting the Impact46 website. We are committed to protecting your personal information and your right to privacy. Impact46 is compliant with the Laws and Regulations of Hong Kong, including the Personal Data Privacy Ordinance (the PDPO), which is the equivalent of the European Union GDPR/RGPD.<br><br>
            When you visit our website <a href="http://www.impact46.co">http://www.impact46.co</a>, and more generally, use any of our services, we appreciate that you are trusting us with your personal information. This Privacy Policy applies to all information collected through our Services (which, as described above, includes our website), as well as any related services, sales, marketing or events. If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, or our practices with regards to your personal information, please contact us at <a href="mailto:impact@impact46.co">impact@impact46.co</a>.<br><br>
        </p>

            <h2>WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</h2>
            <p> <strong>Information automatically collected</strong><br><br>
                <strong>In Short:</strong>  Some information — such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address and/or browser and device characteristics — is collected automatically when you visit our website.<br><br>
                We automatically collect certain information when you visit, use or navigate the website. This information does not reveal your specific identity (like your name or contact information) but may include device and usage information, such as your IP address, browser and device characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, device name, country, location, information about who and when you use our website and other technical information. This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of our website, and for our internal analytics and reporting purposes.<br><br>
                The information we collect includes:
                <ul>
                    <li>Log and Usage Data. Log and usage data is service-related, diagnostic usage and performance information our servers automatically collect when you access or use our website and which we record in log files. Depending on how you interact with us, this log data may include your IP address, device information, browser type and settings and information about your activity in the website (such as the date/time stamps associated with your usage, pages and files viewed, searches and other actions you take such as which features you use), device event information (such as system activity, error reports (sometimes called 'crash dumps') and hardware settings).</li>
                    <li>Device Data. We collect device data such as information about your computer, phone, tablet or other device you use to access the website. Depending on the device used, this device data may include information such as your IP address (or proxy server), device application identification numbers, location, browser type, hardware model Internet service provider and/or mobile carrier, operating system configuration information.</li>
                    <li>Location Data. We collect information data such as information about your device's location, which can be either precise or imprecise. How much information we collect depends on the type of settings of the device you use to access the website. For example, we may use GPS and other technologies to collect geolocation data that tells us your current location (based on your IP address). You can opt out of allowing us to collect this information either by refusing access to the information or by disabling your Locations settings on your device.</li>
                </ul>
            </p><br>
            <h3>HOW DO WE USE YOUR INFORMATION?</h3>
            <p><strong>In Short:</strong>  We process your information for purposes based on legitimate business interests, the fulfillment of our contract with you, compliance with our legal obligations, and/or your consent.<br><br>
                We use personal information collected via our website for a variety of business purposes described below. We process your personal information for these purposes in reliance on our legitimate business interests, in order to enter into or perform a contract with you, with your consent, and/or for compliance with our legal obligations. We indicate the specific processing grounds we rely on next to each purpose listed below.<br><br>
                We use the information we collect or receive:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>To send administrative information to you.</strong> We may use your personal information to send you product, service and new feature information and/or information about changes to our terms, conditions, and policies.</li>
                    <li><strong>To protect our Services.</strong> We may use your information as part of our efforts to keep our Website safe and secure (for example, for fraud monitoring and prevention).</li>
                    <li><strong>To enforce our terms, conditions and policies for business purposes, to comply with legal and regulatory requirements or in connection with our contract.</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>To respond to legal requests and prevent harm.</strong> If we receive a subpoena or other legal request, we may need to inspect the data we hold to determine how to respond.</li>
                    <li><strong>For other business purposes.</strong> We may use your information for other business purposes, such as data analysis, identifying usage trends, determining the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns and to evaluate and improve our Website, products, marketing and your experience. We may use and store this information in aggregated and anonymized form so that it is not associated with individual end users and does not include personal information. We will not use identifiable personal information without your consent.</li>
                </ul>
            </p><br>
            <h3>WILL YOUR INFORMATION BE SHARED WITH ANYONE?</h3>
            <p><strong>In Short:</strong>  We only share information with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services, to protect your rights, or to fulfill business obligations.<br><br>
                We may process or share your data that we hold based on the following legal basis:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Consent:</strong> We may process your data if you have given us specific consent to use your personal information in a specific purpose.</li>
                    <li><strong>Legitimate Interests:</strong> We may process your data when it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests.</li>
                    <li><strong>Performance of a Contract:</strong> Where we have entered into a contract with you, we may process your personal information to fulfill the terms of our contract.</li>
                    <li><strong>Legal Obligations:</strong> We may disclose your information where we are legally required to do so in order to comply with applicable law, governmental requests, a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process, such as in response to a court order or a subpoena (including in response to public authorities to meet national security or law enforcement requirements).</li>
                    <li><strong>Vital Interests:</strong> We may disclose your information where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding potential violations of our policies, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person and illegal activities, or as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.</li>
                </ul><br>
                More specifically, we may need to process your data or share your personal information in the following situations:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Business Transfers.</strong> We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.</li>
                </ul>
            </p><br>
            <h3>HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h3>
            <p><strong>In Short:</strong> We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless otherwise required by law.
            <br><br>
            We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than 6 months.<br><br>
            When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
            </p><br>
            <h3>HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h3>
            <p><strong>In Short:</strong> We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.
                <br><br>
                We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security, and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our website is at your own risk. You should only access the website within a secure environment.
            </p><br>
            <h3>CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h3>
            <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Policy.</p><br>
            <h3>DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE?</h3>
            <p><strong>In Short:</strong> Yes, we will update this notice as necessary to stay compliant with relevant laws.
                <br><br>
                We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated “Revised” date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we may notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy frequently to be informed of how we are protecting your information.
            </p><br>
